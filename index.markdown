Hi, my name is Sanjawrang Ramchiary, and I'm a student at National Institute of
Technology, Silchar, Assam, working towards my Master of Technology in 
Artificial Intelligence.

My interests are in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, NLP.

In my free time, I love watching gaming streams and tournaments and playing 
video games.

This blog is intended as a store for my study materials and other content which I like.
